# Statistical Election Fraud Detection 
## :star: Motivation 
This project develops a statistical method to quantify the degree of systematic manipulation that is inherent to fine-graded election results available 
across a large number of polling stations. `Forensic Data Analytics` `Fraud Detection` 

Often times, countries hold concurrent electoral contests on voting day. When voters arrive at the polling station, they get handed out multiple ballots for different 
races such as 
- presidential election 
- national parliament
- regional parliaments
- referenda

Now consider this: While it is perfectly reasonable that across different races, diverging numbers of valid, invalid and spoiled ballots are observed, the *number of 
ballots received at each polling station necessarily needs to be the same* across all electoral events. 

## :question: Problem 
Look at these scanned vote tabulation sheets from the Local Elections 2019 in Ecuador, South America.
